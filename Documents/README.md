For this project I will be working on my own to come up with an automated exploratory data analysis algorithm. I will do this by creating multiple different algorithms to fit a variety of different curves to a given dataset. I will utilize MSE to judge the overall fitness of a curve. I will come up with an algorithm to match a constant value, a linear sequence, a quadratic sequence, a 2D linear sequence, a 2D quadratic sequence, an exponential curve, a sine wave, a cubic spline, and a PCHIP to a given dataset. I will come up with the algorithm for determining the best parameters for each curve to match the data by utilizing stochastic gradient descent over the entire dataset. Once I have the parameters for a curve fitted I will take the MSE for the whole data set for each curve. I will then compare all of the errors for all of the curves and return the curve that best fits the data along with the error associated with this curve. This whole process will be completely automated.
